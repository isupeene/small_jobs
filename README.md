Connects contractors with small jobs.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into several subdirectories, organized by component.  Each subfolder also has a README explaining its purpose in more detail.
## database-setup
All scripts for setting up the database are here.  Django requires that the database and user already exist before the server can run, so this directory provides scripts for easily creating the user and database.
## web
This folder contains the Django project, which includes the database schema, the web API, and the Job Posting App.
## Android
This folder contains all the code for the Android Job Seeking App.
